Ok, I'm going to follow the face-tutorial from Google
https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/face-tutorial

The end state is to have a web interface where you can upload a video and have it deconstructed into gifs


Expression self similarity in videos
Facial expression summarization



Comparison of the container formats

Seems like best is App Engine Flex
It has features that make it easy to deploy and I can still work with a dockerfile

Requirements
Access from Colab - Google Cloud Storage
Web front end
Some way to process videos to create raw feature vectors and gifs
 - ffmpeg in Docker
 - Google api or affectiva

----------

Google Cloud Images: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images#custom_images
With GPUs! https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/add-gpus#install-gpu-driver


Actually lets use docker

What libs do I want in the end?

Affectiva
https://knowledge.affectiva.com/docs/getting-started-with-the-affectiva-sdk-for-linux
Ubuntu - sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev uuid-dev
CentOS - sudo yum install libcurl-devel.x86_64 libuuid-devel.x86_64
and includes ffmpeg internally



OpenPose
in TensorFlow - https://arvrjourney.com/human-pose-estimation-using-openpose-with-tensorflow-part-1-7dd4ca5c8027
^^ this is cool because I could use the raw NN outputs
Nice because hands
