Strategy will be to use small projects to learn key concepts

Talk to friends about ML, 
If I can't talk about it, I need to study it more!

How to get ML job - according to Andrew Leach
You should have confidence in basic linux, web tech, databases and customer facing, as well as the ability to develop algorithms and translate them quickly to code. Sounds like you'd be pretty solid on those
ML is the big filter though, really need to have a strong understanding, and helps to have code on Github to demo (not necessary though)
Definitely should understand deep neural networks, the mathematics behind them and their training, as well as their pitfalls. Solid understanding of convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, 
(reinforcement learning is a plus).
Need to understand how to bridge the gap between data and model development
emphasis on troubleshooting for the above topics
and should know the classic methods for supervised and unsupervised learning
